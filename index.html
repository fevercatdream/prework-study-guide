        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>!DOCTYPE is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>The head element contains the metadata for our web application.</li>
          <li>Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The charset element sets our character encoding.</li>
          <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>An HTML developer is responsible for not only providing the structure for the webpage but also making sure that it provides a positive user experience.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
          <li>Not all elements are semantic, though. It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as div to create a division in the page, or span to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Order matters! When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest heading,h1, should only appear once on each page.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>Hyperlink, the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>
          <li>The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image. The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website.</li>
          <li>The footer appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li> HTML uses the id attribute as a way to identify elements and select them.</li>
          <li>Debugging is one of the most important parts of the development process. Every day, developers notice errors and review code that isn’t working. It’s important to get into the mindset that errors and mistakes are gifts. They tell us when something is wrong, and if we can stay curious, we can figure out what is happening and learn something new.</li>
          <li>Remember that we can style HTML elements using the elements as selectors or by using the class attribute as a selector.</li>
          <li>&lt;!-- HTML comments go here, will also work in JavaScript --&gt;</li>
          <!-- This is how HTML comments are made, will not show on page when rendered -->

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>Whereas HTML strictly handles the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>inline CSS: When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They’re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>internal CSS style sheet: It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>external CSS style sheet: The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>When we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file. Just because our files are in the same project repository doesn’t mean they know about each other. To do this, we will use the HTML link element.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>*: * selector, a special wild card symbol, selects every element</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused with margin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
          <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <li>The margin is not counted towards the actual size of the box — sure, it affects the total space that the box will take up on the page, but only the space outside the box. The box's area stops at the border — it does not extend into the margin.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li>text-align: This is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
          <li>The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>A link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>.card: The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>
          <li>The most popular are Hex color codes; three byte hexadecimal numbers (meaning they consist of six digits), with each byte, or pair of characters in the Hex code, representing the intensity of red, green and blue in the color respectively.</li>
          <li>Hex code byte values range from 00, which is the lowest intensity of a color, to FF which represents the highest intensity.</li>
          <li>The color white, for example, is made by mixing each of the three primary colors at their full intensity, resulting in the Hex color code of #FFFFFF.</li>
          <li>Black, the absence of any color on a screen display, is the complete opposite, with each color displayed at their lowest possible intensity and a Hex color code of #000000.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Our default branch is called main, but master may also be seen in older repos. We shouldn’t do any coding directly in the main branch. Instead, we will branch off of main and create a feature branch, which is a copy of the main branch. That way, we maintain the main branch and we can track the changes that were made to it via the feature branches.</li>
          <li>When we create a new branch to add something new to our project, we call it a feature branch. That is because we are adding a new feature or functionality to our app!</li>
          <li>In the feature branch, we make commits of all the changes we make to the code while working. We add a commit message that is descriptive of what changed in the code.</li>
          <li>Then we push up the changes to our feature branch in our GitHub repository. But that code is still just in our feature branch and not our main branch. In order to merge our changes to the main branch, we need to open a pull request.</li>
          <li>A pull request, or PR, is used to merge a comparison branch (in our case, the feature branch) into the base branch.</li>
          <li>Once the PR is opened, other developers and collaborators on your team can view those changes you made to the code. They can then comment on it, request changes, and even have a conversation about your changes. You can also view any conflicts you have between your comparison branch and base branch on your PR and resolve them.</li>
          <li>Once your PR is approved, you can merge it into the main branch. After you do that, the code in the main branch is updated with your changes. From this point on, when you want to make another change to the application, you will branch off of this updated main branch.</li>
          <li>cd bootcamp: change directory to bootcamp</li>
          <li>cd prework-study-guide: change directory to prework-study-guide</li>
          <li>pwd: "print working directory" prints the current directory</li>
          <li>cd ..: will go to parent directory, go back one directory</li>
          <li>cd ../: same as "cd .." but can continue to navigate folders following slash</li>
          <li>touch: creates a file</li>
          <li>cat: prints a file to the command line</li>
          <li>code .: will open the directory in VS Code</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>The git command must precede every Git statement.</li>
          <li>The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch.</li>
          <li>The -b flag creates a new branch.</li>
          <li>The branch-name "feature/starter-code" is the name of the new branch. We have added the prefix, feature, to indicate that it is a feature. It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>
          <li>git add -A</li>
          <li>The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area.</li>
          <li>The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "description of what changed in the code": Now that all of our changes have been staged, we can commit them to our repository.</li>
          <li>We use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes implemented.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: Before we push this up to our repo, we should double-check if our local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub. So let’s pull down any changes from the base branch.</li>
          <li>It is a good habit to always pull the base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code.</li>
          <li>"Already up to date.": message appears in terminal if your branches are in sync</li>
          <li>git push origin "feature/starter-code": we are using a new command push to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language.</li>
          <li>In web development, JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive. Every time you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form, JavaScript is at work!</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>The browser reads code in the order it appears in the file. If the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the HTML that hasn't loaded yet, there could be problems. Placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one way to accommodate this dependency. Note that whereas the style.css file is linked within the head element, the script.js file is linked within the body element.</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the &lt;const&gt;, &lt;let&gt;, or &lt;var&gt; keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
          <li>What exactly do we mean by “truthy” and “falsy” in Javascript? A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code. Developers use it daily to debug and test the code that they write.</li>
          <li>String: A sequence of text is known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
          <li>Number: Numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
          <li>Boolean: This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
          <li>Array: An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way. Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on. arrays are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses (). Parameters can be placed inside the parentheses.</li>
          <li>When we create a function, we are defining a block of code that performs a specific task and giving it a unique name. However, just defining a function does not mean it will execute in our code automatically. To execute a function, we must call it in our code.</li>
          <li>Object: This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.</li>
          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments.</li>
          <li>/*
            Everything in between is a comment. This is for multi-line comments.
            */</li>
          <li>// This is a comment. If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes.</li>
          <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
          <li>Addition: + : Add two numbers together or combine two strings.</li>
          <li>Subtraction, Multiplication, Division: -, *, / : These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math.</li>
          <li>Assignment: = : This assigns a value to a variable.</li>
          <li>Strict equality: === : This performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.</li>
          <li>Not, Does-not-equal: !, !== : This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal.</li>
          <li>Note: Mixing data types can lead to some strange results when performing calculations. Be careful that you are referring to your variables correctly, and getting the results you expect. For example, enter '35' + '25' into your console. Why don't you get the result you expected? Because the quote marks turn the numbers into strings, so you've ended up concatenating strings rather than adding numbers. If you enter 35 + 25 you'll get the total of the two numbers.</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code.</li>
          <li>Functions often take arguments: bits of data they need to do their job. Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.</li>
          <li>The alert() function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but we need to give it a string as an argument to tell the function what message to display.</li>
          <li>Note: The return statement tells the browser to return the result variable out of the function so it is available to use. This is necessary because variables defined inside functions are only available inside those functions. This is called variable scoping.</li>
          <li>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response.</li>
          <li>addEventListener() here is called an anonymous function, because it doesn't have a name. There's an alternative way of writing anonymous functions, which we call an arrow function. An arrow function uses () => instead of function ().</li>
          <li>Null is a special value in JavaScript that refers to the absence of a value.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types.</li>
          <li>examples: <br />
            let foo = 42; // foo is now a number <br />
            foo = "bar"; // foo is now a string <br />
            foo = true; // foo is now a boolean <br /></li>
          <li>JavaScript is also a weakly typed language, which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.</li>
          <li>examples: <br />
            const foo = 42; // foo is a number <br />
            const result = foo + "1"; // JavaScript coerces foo to a string, so it can be concatenated with the other operand <br />
            console.log(result); // 421 <br /></li>
          <li>Implicit coercions is very convenient, but can be a potential footgun if developers didn't intend to do the conversion, or intend to convert in the other direction (for example, string to number instead of number to string). For symbols and BigInts, JavaScript has intentionally disallowed certain implicit type conversions.</li>
          <li>All types except Object define immutable values represented directly at the lowest level of the language. We refer to values of these types as primitive values.</li>
          <li>All primitive types, except null, can be tested by the typeof operator. typeof null returns "object", so one has to use === null to test for null.</li>
          <li>The Null type is inhabited by exactly one value: null.</li>
          <li>The Undefined type is inhabited by exactly one value: undefined.</li>
          <li>Conceptually, undefined indicates the absence of a value, while null indicates the absence of an object (which could also make up an excuse for typeof null === "object"). The language usually defaults to undefined when something is devoid of a value.</li>
          <li>A return statement with no value (return;) implicitly returns undefined.</li>
          <li>Accessing a nonexistent object property (obj.iDontExist) returns undefined.</li>
          <li>A variable declaration without initialization (let x;) implicitly initializes the variable to undefined.</li>
          <li>Many methods, such as Array.prototype.find() and Map.prototype.get(), return undefined when no element is found.</li>
          <li>null is a keyword, but undefined is a normal identifier that happens to be a global property. In practice, the difference is minor, since undefined should not be redefined or shadowed.</li>
          <li>The Boolean type represents a logical entity and is inhabited by two values: true and false. <br />
            Boolean values are usually used for conditional operations, including ternary operators, if...else, while, etc. <br /></li>
          <li>The Number type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value. It is capable of storing positive floating-point numbers between 2<sup>-1074</sup> (Number.MIN_VALUE) and 2<sup>1024</sup> (Number.MAX_VALUE) as well as negative floating-point numbers between -2<sup>-1074</sup> and -2<sup>1024</sup> <br /></li>
            <li>Values outside the range ±(2<sup>-1074</sup> to 2<sup>1024</sup>) are automatically converted: <br /></li>
            <li>Positive values greater than Number.MAX_VALUE are converted to +Infinity. <br /></li>
            <li>Positive values smaller than Number.MIN_VALUE are converted to +0. <br /></li>
            <li>Negative values smaller than -Number.MAX_VALUE are converted to -Infinity. <br /></li>
            <li>Negative values greater than -Number.MIN_VALUE are converted to -0. <br /></li>
          <li>The Number type has only one value with multiple representations: 0 is represented as both -0 and +0 (where 0 is an alias for +0). In practice, there is almost no difference between the different representations; for example, +0 === -0 is true.</li>
          <li>NaN ("Not a Number") is a special kind of number value that's typically encountered when the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number. It is also the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself.</li>
          <li>The BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude. With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) for Numbers.</li>
          <li>The String type represents textual data and is encoded as a sequence of 16-bit unsigned integer values representing UTF-16 code units. Each element in the string occupies a position in the string. The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on.</li>
          <li>JavaScript strings are immutable. This means that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it. String methods create new strings based on the content of the current string.</li>
          <li>A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property. In some programming languages, Symbols are called "atoms". The purpose of symbols is to create unique property keys that are guaranteed not to clash with keys from other code.</li>
          <li>In computer science, an object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier. In JavaScript, objects are the only mutable values. Functions are, in fact, also objects with the additional capability of being callable.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of properties. With the object literal syntax, a limited set of properties are initialized; then properties can be added and removed. Object properties are equivalent to key-value pairs. Property keys are either strings or symbols. Property values can be values of any type, including other objects, which enables building complex data structures.</li>
          <li>Data properties associate a key with a value. It can be described by the following attributes: value, writable, enumerable, and configurable.</li>
          <li>Accessor property associates a key with one of two accessor functions (get and set) to retrieve or store a value. An accessor property has the following attributes: get, set, enumerable, and configurable.</li>
          <li>Objects are ad-hoc key-value pairs, so they are often used as maps. However, there can be ergonomics, security, and performance issues. Use a Map for storing arbitrary data instead.</li>
          <li>When representing dates, the best choice is to use the built-in Date utility in JavaScript.</li>
          <li>Arrays are regular objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-keyed properties and the length property.</li>
          <li>Typed Arrays present an array-like view of an underlying binary data buffer, and offer many methods that have similar semantics to the array counterparts. "Typed array" is an umbrella term for a range of data structures, including Int8Array, Float32Array, etc.</li>
          <li>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format, derived from JavaScript, but used by many programming languages. JSON builds universal data structures that can be transferred between different environments and even across languages.</li>
