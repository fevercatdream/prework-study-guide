        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>!DOCTYPE is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>The head element contains the metadata for our web application.</li>
          <li>Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The charset element sets our character encoding.</li>
          <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>An HTML developer is responsible for not only providing the structure for the webpage but also making sure that it provides a positive user experience.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
          <li>Not all elements are semantic, though. It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as div to create a division in the page, or span to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Order matters! When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest heading,h1, should only appear once on each page.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>Hyperlink, the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>
          <li>The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image. The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website.</li>
          <li>The footer appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li> HTML uses the id attribute as a way to identify elements and select them.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Our default branch is called main, but master may also be seen in older repos. We shouldn’t do any coding directly in the main branch. Instead, we will branch off of main and create a feature branch, which is a copy of the main branch. That way, we maintain the main branch and we can track the changes that were made to it via the feature branches.</li>
          <li>When we create a new branch to add something new to our project, we call it a feature branch. That is because we are adding a new feature or functionality to our app!</li>
          <li>In the feature branch, we make commits of all the changes we make to the code while working. We add a commit message that is descriptive of what changed in the code.</li>
          <li>Then we push up the changes to our feature branch in our GitHub repository. But that code is still just in our feature branch and not our main branch. In order to merge our changes to the main branch, we need to open a pull request.</li>
          <li>A pull request, or PR, is used to merge a comparison branch (in our case, the feature branch) into the base branch.</li>
          <li>Once the PR is opened, other developers and collaborators on your team can view those changes you made to the code. They can then comment on it, request changes, and even have a conversation about your changes. You can also view any conflicts you have between your comparison branch and base branch on your PR and resolve them.</li>
          <li>Once your PR is approved, you can merge it into the main branch. After you do that, the code in the main branch is updated with your changes. From this point on, when you want to make another change to the application, you will branch off of this updated main branch.</li>
          <li>cd bootcamp: change directory to bootcamp</li>
          <li>cd prework-study-guide: change directory to prework-study-guide</li>
          <li>pwd: "print working directory" prints the current directory</li>
          <li>code .: will open the directory in VS Code</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout main: to switch to the main branch</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>The git command must precede every Git statement.</li>
          <li>The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch.</li>
          <li>The -b flag creates a new branch.</li>
          <li>The branch-name "feature/starter-code" is the name of the new branch. We have added the prefix, feature, to indicate that it is a feature. It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>
          <li>git add -A</li>
          <li>The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area.</li>
          <li>The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "description of what changed in the code": Now that all of our changes have been staged, we can commit them to our repository.</li>
          <li>We use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes implemented.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: Before we push this up to our repo, we should double-check if our local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub. So let’s pull down any changes from the base branch.</li>
          <li>git push origin "feature/starter-code": we are using a new command push to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>
